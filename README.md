# 🐍 Python Code Journal

A **code-first journal** documenting my Python learning journey — from fundamentals to internals, with hands-on experiments and clear explanations.

## 📌 About
This repository contains Python code, notes, and examples created while learning Python in depth.  
The focus is not just *how* Python works, but also *why* it works that way, covering concepts, internals, and practical usage.

## 🎯 Topics Covered
- Python basics and core syntax  
- Data types and mutability  
- Memory model and reference counting  
- `repr()`, `str()`, object behavior  
- Lists, dicts, sets, and internals  
- Small experiments to validate concepts  

## 🚀 Purpose
- Build **strong Python fundamentals**
- Understand **Python under the hood**
- Maintain a **personal code journal**
- Prepare for **interviews, open-source, and backend development**

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3  
- **Tools:** Git, GitHub  

## 📖 How to Use
- Browse folders topic-wise  
- Read code comments for explanations  
- Run files to observe behavior  
- Modify and experiment freely  

## 📌 Status
🚧 Actively updated as learning progresses.
